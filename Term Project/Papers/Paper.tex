\section{Project Overview}
This is the output of the Project Analysis R file used to run the analysis of my project.


My analysis begins with some summary statistics on the dataset I chose for my project:


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/HistogramCallsforAllNames.eps}
\caption{Calls for All Names}
\label{fig:allcalls}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram-CallsforCaucasianNames.eps}
\caption{Calls for Caucasian Names}
\label{fig:whitecalls}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram-CallsforAfricanAmericanNames.eps}
\caption{Calls for African American Names}
\label{fig:blackcalls}
\end{figure}


This gives a little insight into the data, but I will further explain here. This dataset is the result of sending 4870 randomized resumes to employers in the Chicago and Boston area for numerous jobs. What is being analyzed here? Whether or not these resumes garnered a call back based on the first name listed on the resume. Half of the resumes have what Americans would consider a white or Caucasian name, while the other half have an African American name associated with it. I am using the 'call' variable - a binary 'yes' or 'no' data value - as the dependent variable for my analysis.


\section{Analysis}


Here are some summary statistics on the explanatory variables within this dataset that I have hand-picked from the full dataset for this project:


\input{../Tables/summary1.tex}


\input{../Tables/summary2.tex}


\input{../Tables/summary3.tex}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram - Names, Caucasian.eps}
\caption{Histogram of Caucasian Names}
\label{fig:whitenames}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram - Names, African Americans.eps}
\caption{Histogram of African American Names}
\label{fig:blacknames}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram - Names, Male.eps}
\caption{Histogram of Male Names}
\label{fig:malenames}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Figures/Histogram - Names, Female.eps}
\caption{Histogram of Female Names}
\label{fig:femalenames}
\end{figure}


Just to demonstrate how randomized the resumes were when the study was conducted, I have displayed this table below. This shows all of the resumes with the name Tanisha. Each resume has its own combination of criteria:


\input{../Tables/SampleData.tex}


\section{Logistic Regression Model}


After reviewing the data and some of the variables' statistics, I created a logistic regression model to fit to the dataset. Below are the results of the model:

\section{Data Dictionary}


For reference, here are explanations and definitions for some of the less obvious independent variables:
